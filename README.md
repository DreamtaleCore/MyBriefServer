__folder structure__
Every folder here contains project file and a _webroot_ file, you can change the contain in it, and named the main in port as ``index.html``

__Tips:__
1. The first folder is a project created by ``visual studio 2015``, through using ``winSock``+``c++`` to realize the project just asking the clients what the ``html`` they need, need _TODO_ here.
2. The second folder is a project created by ``intellij IDEA``, through using ``Java`` to realize the project just asking the clients what the ``html`` they need, a perfect one I think.
3. The third folder is a project created by ``wing IDE``, through using ``Python`` to realize the project just asking the clients what the ``html`` they need, need _TODO_ here.
