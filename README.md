###folder name

1. byCxx_vs
2. byJava_intellij
3. byPython_wing

###folder structure

Every folder here contains project file and a _webroot_ folder, you can change the contain in it, and named the main in port as ``index.html``

###Tips:

1. The first folder is a project created by ``visual studio 2015``, through using ``winSock``+``c++`` to realize the project just asking the clients what the ``html`` they need, need _TODO_ here.
2. The second folder is a project created by ``intellij IDEA``, through using ``Java`` to realize the project just asking the clients what the ``html`` they need, a perfect one I think.
3. The third folder is a project created by ``wing IDE``, through using ``Python`` to realize the project just asking the clients what the ``html`` they need, need _TODO_ here.

###Runï¼š

1. ``c++``:    Just run, and use browser open the localhost:port you set
2. ``java``:   delete the ip in the HttpServer, and open ``localhost:2345/index.html`` in broswer
3. ``python``: just as ``c++``
